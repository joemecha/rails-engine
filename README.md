## General info
RAILS ENGINE -- As a devloper working for a FICTITIOUS company developing an E-Commerce Application, my team is working in a service-oriented architecture (the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs). 

This project is a build of a Rails API to expose the data that powers the site, which the front end would then consume.

### Features:
  * ???

## To-do list:
* FULLY test API endpoints for happy/sad paths and edge cases (on-going)
* Expose the RESTful API endpoints for:
  * Merchants:
    - get all merchants, a maximum of 20 at a time
    - get one merchant
    - get all items for a given merchant ID
  * Items:
    - get all items, a maximum of 20 at a time
    - get one item
    - create an item
    - edit an item
    - delete an item
    - get the merchant data for a given item ID
* Expose non-RESTful API endpoints for:
  * ONE of following endpoint pairs:
    * find one MERCHANT based on search criteria AND find all ITEMS based on search criteria
    * find one ITEM based on search criteria AND find all MERCHANTS based on search criteria
* Expose FOUR of the following for a total of 15 endpoints:
  * find a quantity of merchants sorted by descending revenue
  * find a quantity of merchants sorted by descending item quantity sold
  * total revenue generated in the whole system over a start/end date range
  * total revenue for a given merchant
  * find a quantity of items sorted by descending revenue
  * total revenue of successful invoices which have not yet been shipped
  * revenue report, broken down by month in ascending date order
